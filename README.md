# Imbalanced-Learning
Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method
Imbalanced learning is having large number of data samples for one class and relatively few number of samples for other class. There a are many challenges in imbalanced learning. This imbalance arises because of rare data samples of a particular class. For example in finance fields there might be less number of samples for fraudulent examples and large number of samples for non-fradulent examples.
1. Adaptive Synthetic Sampling method for imbalanced learning-
  -In this we will generate data samples for minority classes. Specifically we will generate more data samples for minority class which difficult to learn in contrast to minority class which easier to learn.
  -It is not only reduce bias but also shifts the decision boundary to focus on minority class which are difficult to learn
  -Objective for this algorithm is reducing bias and adaptive learning.
